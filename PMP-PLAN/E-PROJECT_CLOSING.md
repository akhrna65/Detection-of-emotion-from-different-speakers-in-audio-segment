#### 3. Final Project Report
**DETECTION OF EMOTION FROM MULTIPLE SPEAKERS IN AUDIO SEGMENT**

**1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

The project. was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that are able to recognise, control, and comprehend one's own emotions as well as those of others. Besides, ascertain the customer's feelings, which a text channel cannot convey. With this we can also enhance human-machine interaction. 

**2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS**

We tested the accuracy of the system when the project is finish. The system accuracy is 85%.

**3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE**

The project is following Gantt chart scheduled as every memeber doing all the task accordingly. So, the actual progress fits the original schedule.

**5.0 PROJECT ASSESSMENT**

**5.1 SCOPE**

The scope of the project was established at the outset. For instance, the system is not test using other language audio like mandarin or spanish. only english language audio is tested in the project. but the system is able to detect emotion only throught human voices. the way they speak, the tone and volume. all of it effect the detection. so we can test it in the future.

**5.2 OBJECTIVES**

Our team managed to achieve the objectives initialized at the beginning of the project. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which uses deep-learning technique has been made. Deep learning is used in this project to detect the audio input to the system.

**5.3 IMPACTS**

By creating this system, we can know one's emotions only using the audio given. this can bring help in many situations or problems. In the crime or investigation situation, we can detect the accuser's emotion through the investigation and conclude out of it. wheather the accuser is lying or not after the emotion from the speech is detected.

**6.0 TRANSITION PLAN**

Our team mambers can provide support when require or if there is a problem arise. The main work of support are as shown below:

i) Give maintain the system

ii) Handling errors and updates of the system

iii) Provide user guidelines for easy operation of the system

iv) Report information gain to senior management montly basis
