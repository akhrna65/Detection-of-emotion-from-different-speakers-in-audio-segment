# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT PLAN
### Deliverables:
Hardware Requirement:
For the hardware, our group uses the laptop which consists of intel core i5 and 8GB RAM to conduct our project.

#### Software Requirement:
For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing car plate and PHP programming language to design the website and database connection. 

#### Intelligent System Architecture:
The proposed neural network is deep naural network, which is a type of convolution neural network.
neural network architecture:

#### Outcomes of the system
the main steps that will be applied in our system, which is audio detection. Given the input audio, the first process are to use speaker diarization for finding speaker change points in an audio stream, using feature Extraction and Use Convolutional Neural Network to recognize emotion.
