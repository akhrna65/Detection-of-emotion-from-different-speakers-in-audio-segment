# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life cycle

The Gantt Chart used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables the team members to consistently follow the guidelines and reach the milestones. The cycle of a project WBS divides each member's role and work into a number of modules. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own responsibilities and contributions to make at each phase of the lifecycle.

Project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

As for the Detection of Different Speakers in Audio Segment Project, the system WBS is shown below. This WBS is designed to segment the project's technical component into various sections such as initiating, project plannning, execution, controlling and close project.

### Scope
A work breakdown structure (WBS) is created to map all the necessary tasks and develop the process which the WBS will be maintained and approved.

In this car plate recognition project, we need to identify the scope of the project. For instance, the project will not accept car plate number that are unique as it does not follow the government rules. For example, the car plate number is reflecting to lights and car plate number with special fonts will not be acceptable. Besides, this project scope down the limit of the project by only detect alphabet and number character. Therefore, country such as Japan and Thailand might not be able to use this system.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | Wrong Possibilities | Time and Ways to Detect | Risk Prevention  |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Having a poor quality attitude; design, materials, and skills; insufficient programmes for quality assurance)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system confused with different speaker emotion detection <br> (Ex. Different person has similar voice) <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model not support speakers with low voice tones.  |Way: The output categorized wrong speaker and emotion <br> <br> Time: The risk found during testing phase|Assign one person to continue daily data collection and expand the dataset until a satisfactory outcome is found.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; , unsatisfactory output, cost, change, or turning point)|1. Turning Point: The cost to repair the system will be charged if the server got hacked and customer's information revealed. <br><br> 2. Unsatisfactory Output: It might be difficult for team members to complete tasks by the deadline when natural disasters like earthquakes and floods occur which lead to additional expenses for allocation in cloud serves.|Way: The company's financial flow shows a sharp rise in cost .<br><br>Time: The issue will most likely arise during project execution and project implementation.|Contact and discuss with the customer whenever the budget exceed.  
|Time <br> (errors in predicting the availability of resources or time; error occur during identifying the crucial route; lack float management and allocation ; prompt launch of competing products) | 1. Errors in predicting availability of resources or time: Task progress exceed the target milestone shown in Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Prompt launch of competing products: The products unable to gives what they promises because lack of time.|Way: Since all assigned tasks are necessary to finish the project, it will have an impact on all members if one member's work progress falls behind the milestone. <br><br> Time: During the project execution and monitoring phase, the issue will arise.| Ask or voice out problem to get help from other members and learn to give the best contribution and progress outcome to the project team.|

### Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM)  
RAM are needed to structure and make the project more clear. The matrix outlines the task provide for the members in order to finish the project    

R-Responsible: The person that will carry out the task  
A-Accountable: The person that asssign the task to others and signs off after task complete  
C-Consult: The person that give expert advice or involve on review af finieshed project  
I-Inform: The person that inform the accountable person if any task complete
